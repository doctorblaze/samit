title: Welcome to SAMIT

The aim of this toolbox is to facilitate the construction of new tracer specific templates and the subsequent voxel-based and/or volume-of-interest based analysis of small animal PET and SPECT brain images. In human studies, the analysis of functional neuroimaging data is frequently performed with [SPM](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) software. We decided to develop a toolbox that introduces minimal changes to the original SPM code, being compatible with the most recent versions of SPM (SPM8 and SPM12). Moreover, this toolbox is focused in the analysis of small animal PET and SPECT functional brain images.

The software is distributed with a T<sub>2</sub>-MRI rat template coregistered with the Paxinos anatomical atlas [Schwarz et al. 2006](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.04.214) and the rat PET and SPECT templates developed for the paper.

Further documentation is under development.

## The SAMIT project

SAMIT is focused in the needs of the research community performing neuroimaging studies in small animal PET and SPECT. Most of the current functions are based on the experience and requirements of our department. Therefore, any suggestion, bug report, or feature request is more than appreciated.

SAMIT software is developed on and hosted in GitHub. Head to the [SAMIT repository] (https://github.com/dvallezgarcia/samit) for more details. Or contact us at <samit@umcg.nl>

Thanks!
