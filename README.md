# SAMIT (Small Animal Molecular Imaging Toolbox)
The aim of this toolbox is to facilitate the construction of new tracer specific templates and the subsequent voxel-based analysis of small animal PET and SPECT brain images.
In human studies, the analysis of functional neuroimaging data is frequently performed with the SPM software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, University College London, UK).
We decided to develop a toolbox producing minimal changes to the original SPM code, compatible with the most recent versions of SPM (SPM8 and SPM12). Moreover, this toolbox is focused in the analysis of small animal PET and SPECT functional brain images.

Further documentation is under development.
